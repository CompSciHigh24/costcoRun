# Unit 1: Lesson 10 - Modularization Lab

Welcome to the **Modularization** lab! This exercise will have you managing a grocery list using functions. By the end, you'll be able to add, remove, update, display, and clear items from the list, as well as count how many items are left.

## Sections
1. **Part 1**: Turning existing code into modularized functions, specifying inputs and returns.
2. **Part 2**: Adding features with two new functions: one to count items and one to clear the list.
3. **Part 3**: Creating a charcuterie board by calling functions in the right order to match a specific output.
